Android Library for saving and sharing a base64 encoded PDF.

## Motivation
****
Sharing a base64 PDF works on iOS with the React Native API but it's not working for Android. The `ShareFile` JAVA module shows that's possible by saving the document on local storage of the device and sharing it.

## Demo

## Install

```shell
npm i react-native-share-pdf
```

## Usage

```js
import RNShareFile from 'react-native-share-pdf';

async function loadAndSharePDF() {
  const showError = await RNShareFile.sharePDF(mockData.document, mockData.filename);
  if (showError) {
    // Do something with the error
  }
}

```

## Methods

* RNShareFile.share(base64Data, documentFileName);

### Manual Installation

React Native > 0.60 will autolink. For earlier versions:

1. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java`
  - Add `import com.maximegerbe.reactnative.sharefile.ShareFilePackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
  - Add `new ShareFilePackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method
2. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:
    ```
    include ':react-native-share-pdf'
    project(':react-native-share-pdf').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-share-pdf/android')
    ```
3. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in `android/app/build.gradle`:
    ```
    implementation project(':react-native-share-pdf')
    ```
